The Frontend (Angular 8) Repo for the Mintbean Javascript Challenge.  

I've spent a total of 60 hours maybe with Angular 2 over the past 2 years (~30 in the past 2 days), and I still feel like it's hour 3.  I struggle to grasp it becuase I use it so infrequently, but it's pretty darn cool.  It's an improvement over AngularJS in some areas, but some I feel have become... a little more tedious to say the least.

Express is cool.  Except for when it isn't.  Then it's not.  But when it's cool, boy oh boy is it cool!  It's probably going to be my go to for backends from now on.  So quick and easy to throw something together.  Especially if you have a starting point to work with, and this will be my starting point from now on.  Literally plug and play, it's so cool!

This could have been done in maybe 6-8 hours by rusty me (current me) if I had taken my old AngularJS + Yii2 project and copy pasta snip snip Ctrl H (or Ctrl R, depending on where you code) the entire thing together, including the bonus livechatting feature.  I'm assuming it's not TOO much more to go from here, but to figure out configuration for both Angular and Express, it'll take me another day I'm sure.
I kept my guide using/copy pasting to a minimum for this to really get back into coding.  It was fun.  I'll be coding more often now, especially some Express.  Not sure if Angular or Kotlin though... ðŸ¤”

Well, time to go eat and sleep like a normal person!
